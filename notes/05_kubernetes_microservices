- Installing k3s and kubectl

    - To install k3s on a Linux client:

        # Install k3s
        $ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

        # Restart k3s in docker mode
        $ sudo systemctl edit --full k3s.service
        # Replace `ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/k3s` with `ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/k3sserver --docker`

        $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        $ sudo systemctl restart k3s
        $ sudo systemctl enable k3s

        # Allow access outside of root to KUBECTL config
        $ sudo chmod 644 /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

        # Add your user to the docker group, to be able to run docker commands
        # You may need to log out and log in again for the group to take effect
        $ sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER


    - Now, we can check all running pods.

        $ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces


    - Finally, we also need to install the Ingress controller.

        $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/
            controller-v1.1.2/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml



- Comparing Kubernetes with Docker Swarm

    - Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration tool that allows us to manage and deploy 
        multiple containers that interact with each other in a coordinated way.


    - Docker has a native extension of docker-compose meant to work with multiple servers called
        Docker Swarm.  This allows us to use the same YAML files we used to set up our local
        cluster.


    - Docker Swarm has a shorter learning curve, but Kubernetes is way more powerful and
        customizable.



- Understanding the Kubernetes Elements

    - Nodes 
        = physical machines or VMs that support the abstraction of the other elements
        = don't need to be identical but often are for simplicity
        = abstracted away by Kubernetes


    - Kubernetes Control Plane
        = where all processes used by Kubernetes are kept
        = usually kept on a separate network so that problems won't affect running cluster


    - Kubernetes Objects

        - Container
            = single Docker container

        - Pod
            = basic deployable unit, one or more containers
            = usually a single container, maybe an additional one for auxiliary tasks like metrics
            = all container in pod share same IP (pod IP)

        - ConfigMap
            = defines a set of key/value pairs that can be injected into pods
            = typically as env variables or files

        - Volume
            = persistent storage

        - Deployment
            = grouping of one or more identical pods
            = if pods are deleted, finished, or have problems, the deployment will start a new one

        - Job
            = creates one or more pods that are expected to finish
            = there are also 'cron jobs', which will run at specified times

        - Service
            = service needs to define a name so that other elements can discover it
            = typically related to a deployment

        - Ingress
            = while a service is internal, and egress is external
            = routes any external requests to the appropriate service so they can be served
            = internally, is a container that implements the ingress controller (nginx by default)

        - Namespace
            = definition of a virtual cluster
            = must have unique name



- Defining an Element

    - We can use kubectl to create a new element.

        # Create a namespace
        $ kubectl create namespace example

        # List namespaces
        $ kubectl get namespaces


    - A namespace is a special example since it doesn't need any configuration, but other 
        elements require YAML files that describe the element.

      For example, to create a new pod using the official nginx image from Docker Hub:

        # example_pod.yml
        ------------------
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: nginx
          namespace: example
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: nginx
              image: library/nginx:latest


    - To run this pod:

        # Run example pod
        $ kubectl apply -f example_pod.yml

        # List all pods
        $ kubectl get pods -n example


    - To exec into the container and make sure it is up and serving files:

        $ kubectl exec -it nginx -n example /bin/bash


    - To edit the pod while it is running:

        $ kubectl edit pod nginx -n example

      Or we can edit the 'example_pod.yml' file and restart the pod.



- Getting More Information

    - We can get more information by using the '-w' (wide) option.

        # Get details of pods
        $ kubectl get pods -n example -o wide
        $ kubectl get pods -n example -w


    - We can use 'describe' to get more information about a particular element.

        $ kubectl describe pod nginx -n example



- Removing an Element

    - The 'delete' command removes an element and everything under it.

        # Delete namespace
        $ kubectl delete namespace example

        # Ensure associated pods are deleted
        $ kubectl get pods -n example



- Troubleshooting a Running Cluster

    - If we get an 'ErrImagePull' error, we couldn't download from the image registry, possibly
        due to authentication problems.


    - A status of 'CrashLoopBackOff' means that the process for the container has been interrupted.

        # Check stdout logs of a container
        $ kubectl logs <pod> -n <namespace> -c <container>

        # Manually run a container
        $ docker run <image>
